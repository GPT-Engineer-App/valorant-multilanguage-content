# valorant-multilanguage-content

Update the website to include language-specific sections for Valorant gameplay clips and educational videos. Each language should have its own page or section, enabling users to select their preferred language and access content tailored to them. This should include separate files or directories for each language, ensuring that the site is organized and accessible for a global audience. The design should maintain the dark, neon aesthetic of Valorant, with intuitive navigation to switch between languages.
